I am an assistant professor at Université de Sherbrooke since Fall 2017. This is also where I obtained my Ph. D. in 2014.

Between 2015 and 2017, I was a postdoc researcher under the supervision of Adriana Tapus at ENSTA ParisTech near Paris, France.
I worked on adaptive behaviors for service robots, and I spent most of my time working within the EU Horizon 2020 ENRICHME project, which aimed at delivering autonomous robots for the elderly with mild cognitive impairments.

I am a member of Ordre des Ingénieurs du Québec (OIQ), ACM and IEEE.
